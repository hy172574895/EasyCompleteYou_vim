# Easy Complete You (ECY)
ECY trying to stasify you all the time or piss you off sometimes.
let get to the straight, here the disavantages:
1. Write in vimL, using the channel of vim to comunicate with LSP servers.
so it could be slow or block sometimes.
2. Support neovim theoretically, have never test in neovim.
3. Have no any interface to customize a LSP source.
4. Coincidence-oriented programming.(I don't care it if it's works.)

## installation
using some Plugin-manager like Plug-vim or Vunble:
Put the line into your vimrc.
 ``
## usage 
you have to provide some infomation of LSP server, such as pyls, the file-type 
of pyls.
